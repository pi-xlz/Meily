1. Create Database with necessary fields(like: "shorturl", "realurl",)
2. Find a way to make your shorturl's unique
3. Create a form that accepts the url i.e, the frontend application
4. Find a way to redirect users to the intended url from your backend application
    This would be done in such a way that when the user makes a request(clicks on the shortened url you generated from wherever) to your backend
    using the shortened url, you redirect them to the intended url.
